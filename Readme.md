# Alexa Skill state capital quiz

This Alex Skill is a little game to help my kids learn US state capitals.

It asks questions like:

"What's the capital of North Carolina?"
"Albany is the capital of which state?"

It's an excuse for me to play around with:

- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- [The Alexa Skills node
  sdk](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs)
- [Sanctuary.js](https://sanctuary.js.org)


It's a modified version of the [the Alexa sample trivia app](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia).
